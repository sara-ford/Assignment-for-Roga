## Contents

- **builddataset (Python script):**  
  Generates a CSV file with people’s details
- **data.csv:**  
  The CSV file generated by the `builddataset` script, containing the dataset to be analyzed.
- **C# Console Application:**  
  Reads the CSV file and performs analysis as described below.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Generation (Python)

The `builddataset` Python script creates a CSV file (`data.csv`) with relevant details for each person.  
You can run this script using:

bash
python builddataset


The output (`data.csv`) is expected to include at least columns for age and weight.

### 2. Data Analysis (C#)

A simple C# console app is included to process and analyze the generated dataset. The app reads `data.csv` and answers the following queries:

1. **Find the average age of all people.**
2. **Find the total number of people weighing between 120lbs and 140lbs.**
3. **Find the average age of the people weighing between 120lbs and 140lbs.**

To run the C# console app:

bash
dotnet run

(or use your preferred method to run a C# console application)

## Repository Structure


/builddataset.py                 # Python script to generate data.csv
/People_dataset.csv              # CSV file with all details
/People_dataset_Analyzer         # Directory for the C# console app 


## Requirements

- Python 3.x (to generate the dataset)
- .NET SDK (to run the C# console application)

## Usage

1. Run the Python script to generate or refresh `data.csv`.
2. Build and run the C# console application to perform the required analyses.

## Output

When you run the C# console app, you’ll see the answers to:

- The average age of all people
- The number of people weighing between 120lbs and 140lbs (inclusive)
- The average age of people in that weight range
